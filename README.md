- [x] The minimum loan amount is R$50,000.00.
- [x] The installment amount must be divided month by month into equal installments.
- [x] After making the simulation, allow the user to execute the loan, the information must be saved in a database or JSON, because it will be necessary to create an endpoint in the API so that we can consume this data.
- [x] After the loan is made, just show a message informing that the request was made successfully.
